**_What English mathematician and writer is often regarded as the first computer programmer?_**

```
Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852)
was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's 
proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was credited and still
known to be the first computer programmer. However few apparently know is that she worked off of Babbage’s 
prior examples, which were not published, but have been part of the historical record since the 1970s,
when Babbage’s designs surfaced, and were donated to the London Science Museum by his descendants.

Tl;dr : 
Officially - Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace
Unofficially - Charles Babbage

Though it was first named 'Turing machines' by Alonzo Church in a review of 
Turing's paper in reference to Turing's 'a machines' (automatic machines).
